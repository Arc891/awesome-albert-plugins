# meme-generator - Albert plugin

## Description

Generate memes from a variety of image selection and add your custom text.
Then, copy it to your clipboard, or save it to disk.

Optionally you can add effects to the meme, e.g., shaking.

The meme generation runs offline, there's no need to be connected to the internet.

## Installation instructions

* Install [meme](https://github.com/nomad-software/meme) directly from github.
  You'll need a relatively recent version of `go` for this. You could use
  [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) if that's not supported by your package
  manager.
* Install [xclip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xclip)
