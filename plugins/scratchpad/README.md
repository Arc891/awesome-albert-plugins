# Scratchpad - Albert plugin

## Description

Capture all of your thoughts and one-line notes to a single text file.
Use `s ` to trigger the plugin, add whatever text you want and on ENTER albert
will save it to a designated textfile.

This way you can capture all your thoughts to a file and then decide whether you
want to spend the time to further organise these better / split them to multiple
files, etc.
