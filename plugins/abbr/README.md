# abbr - Albert plugin

## Description

Lookup words stored in a file along with their description.

This is a, rather esoteric, plugin that looks up and saves pairs of (key, value) in a specified
file on disk.

I use it to lookup items from my personal abbreviations list. You can also add
new items to it by using the `new` keyword
