## Description

This is a collection of plugins for the
[Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) launcher.

Currently the list of plugins includes:

Plugins have been tested with the Albert python `v0.3` interface but there's no
reason they shouldn't work with the `v0.2` as well (if they don't raise an
issue). I'm using Python `3.6.8` (again, raise an issue if it doesn't work in
your case).

## Demo

## Motivation

It's really so easy writing plugins and automating parts of your workflow using
Albert and its python extensions. That's pretty much the reason I started
writing them.

## Manual installation instructions

Requirements:

- Albert - [Installation instructions](https://albertlauncher.github.io/docs/installing/)
    - Albert Python Interface: ``v0.2``

Download and run the ``install-plugin.sh`` script or run the following to do
that automatically:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bergercookie/awesome-albert-plugins/master/install-plugin.sh | bash
```

that I'm currently either working on or interested in implementing in the near
future. In case there's something you are interesting in working on, don't
hesitate to either ask for clarifications or just do it and directly make a PR.
